# üê≥ Docker Setup Guide - MCP Payments

This guide covers the streamlined Docker setup for the MCP Payments Enterprise system, optimized for both development and production environments.

## üìã Overview

The Docker setup has been completely redesigned to focus on:
- **Development Efficiency**: Live code reloading without rebuilds
- **Production Ready**: Optimized builds with resource limits
- **Simplified Management**: Easy-to-use scripts and commands
- **Essential Services Only**: Backend, Frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis

- Environment variable defaults for development
- Health checks for dependencies
- Volume mounts ready for development override

### Override Configuration (docker-compose.override.yml)

Automatically applied in development with:
- Development build targets
- Source code volume mounts
- Live reload configurations
- Development tools with profiles

### Production Configuration (docker-compose.prod.yml)

Production-optimized configuration with:

- Resource limits and reservations
- Production logging configuration
- Security-focused settings
- Proper restart policies

## üìä Resource Management

### Development Resources
- Minimal resource constraints
- Focus on development experience
- Optional tools available

### Production Resources
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '2.0'
      memory: 2G
    reservations:
      cpus: '1.0'
      memory: 1G
```

## üîç Monitoring & Logging

### Development Logging
- Console output for immediate feedback
- Volume-mounted logs directory
- Service-specific log access

### Production Logging
```yaml
logging:
  driver: "json-file"
  options:
    max-size: "50m"
    max-file: "3"
```

## üö¶ Health Checks

All services include health checks:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Conflicts:**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8000
# Stop conflicting services or change ports
```

**Permission Issues:**
```bash
# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./logs ./data
```

**Container Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check logs
./scripts/dev.sh logs [service-name]
# Rebuild if needed
./scripts/dev.sh rebuild
```

**Live Reload Not Working:**
```bash
# Ensure volume mounts are correct
./scripts/dev.sh status
# Check file watching is enabled
docker-compose exec mcp-payments ps aux | grep uvicorn
```

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export DEBUG=true

# Check service logs in detail
./scripts/dev.sh logs backend -f

# Open shell in container for investigation
./scripts/dev.sh shell backend
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Clean**: Always start with `./scripts/dev.sh clean` if issues occur
2. **Use Scripts**: Prefer the dev script over direct docker-compose commands
3. **Check Status**: Regular `./scripts/dev.sh status` to monitor services
4. **Monitor Logs**: Keep logs open during development for immediate feedback

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit production secrets
2. **Resource Limits**: Always set appropriate resource limits
3. **Health Checks**: Ensure all health checks are properly configured
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups before deployments
5. **Rolling Updates**: Use proper deployment strategies for zero downtime

### Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**: Use external secret management in production
2. **Network Security**: Implement proper network policies
3. **User Permissions**: Run containers with non-root users
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep base images and dependencies updated
