🚀 Updated Development Rules
1. Backend Development Rules
✅ All core services implemented - Use existing service layer
✅ MCP tools completed - 25+ AI tools ready for use
✅ Database layer ready - Use existing repositories and models
⚠️ Background tasks needed - Implement Celery tasks for async processing
⚠️ WebSocket support needed - Add real-time communication
2. Frontend Development Rules
✅ API integration completed - All components use real backend APIs
✅ Core dashboards implemented - Analytics, payments, wallets, monitoring
❌ Subscription management missing - Implement subscription UI
❌ Settings interface missing - Add system configuration UI
❌ Mobile optimization needed - Responsive design implementation
3. Pub/Sub Implementation Rules
✅ RabbitMQ configured - Docker compose setup complete
✅ Celery configured - Workers and beat scheduler ready
❌ Task definitions missing - Create app/tasks/ directory
❌ Message routing missing - Implement event-driven architecture
❌ WebSocket integration missing - Real-time frontend updates
🚫 Updated Anti-Patterns to Avoid
Backend Anti-Patterns
❌ Don't duplicate existing services - Use implemented analytics, payment, wallet services
❌ Don't hardcode provider configs - Use existing integration layer
❌ Don't bypass MCP tools - Use the 25+ implemented AI tools
❌ Don't ignore async patterns - Follow existing async/await implementation
❌ Don't create new database models - Use existing comprehensive models
Frontend Anti-Patterns
❌ Don't hardcode data - All components must use ApiService for dynamic data
❌ Don't duplicate API calls - Use existing service layer and React Query
❌ Don't ignore error handling - Follow existing error boundary patterns
❌ Don't bypass authentication - Use existing JWT token management
❌ Don't create static dashboards - All metrics must be dynamic from backend
Architecture Anti-Patterns
❌ Don't bypass notification service - Use existing multi-channel notification system
❌ Don't create custom queues - Use configured RabbitMQ/Celery infrastructure
❌ Don't ignore monitoring - Use existing Prometheus metrics and health checks
❌ Don't duplicate validation - Use existing Pydantic models and schemas
